Consider the CIFAR10 dataset. Download the dataset and Display 10 image, one each
from the 10 different classes. In the following classification problem divide the dataset
into : train, validation and test set. (choose your own ratio )
  a. Create a simple ResNet from scratch using pytorch/keras to perform a 5 class
  classification from the CIFAR10 dataset.
  b. Plot the loss and accuracy vs epoch for the train set, validation and test set.
  Visualize the output from each layer of the ResNet.
  c. Modify the network architecture such as number of layers, number of neurons in
  the layers or the activation function to improve the test accuracy. Repeat step (b)
  for the new neural network.
